# EngramNCA (Engram Neural Cellular Automata)
<p>This is the anonymous repository for the Engram Neural Cellular Automata Paper and all relevant code.</p>
<p>Videos of the experiments in the paper are available in the Videos folder.</p>
<p>Additional experiments of channel privatization and mathematical details of EngramNCA are available in Appendix_to_submitted_paper.pdf</p>
<p>EngramNCA.ipynb may not work due to anonymization. All experiments can be replicated using the notebooks in the GeneCA_Experiments folder</p>
