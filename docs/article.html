    <h2>Model(s)</h2>
    <p>Description of both models, including illustrations of their architecture and how they interact.</p>

    <p>Taking inspiration from RNA memory transfer in Planarians and Aplysia californica, we augment the NCA hidden state with a "private tape".
    Instead of extending the classic NCA model by appending the tape to the hidden states, we choose to sacrifice hidden states by privatizing them, this ensures that any
    improvements seen are not due to an increase in model size. The theory here is that the private tape augmentation can be exploited to encode different modalities of behaviour,
    such as growing different shapes or representing different calculations.</p>

    <p>We chose to encode different "primitives" in the tape through binary representation. These primitives can consist of simple shapes such as convex polygons or
    more complex, convex, compound shapes such as body segments of a lizard emoji.</p>

    <p>The tape length has to be chosen such that 2^gene_channels is greater or equal to the number of primitives. This ensures that there are enough
    distinct binary encoding for each primitive. However, due to reasons that will be discussed later, it is often preferable to have a buffer of genes that are not used
    in the binary encoding. There is a delicate balance between the number of gene bits and shared hidden channels that needs to be reached as privatisation of channels
    ensures a performance penalty (see Appendix 1.). </p>

    <h3>GeneCA</h3>


    <p>The first model (<a href="#figure-div" class="figure-link" data-target="figure-div"></a>), which we choose to name GeneCA, is tasked with learning the primitive embedding. It takes
    inspiration form the original NCA <d-cite key="mordvintsev2020growing"></d-cite> and is extended to also include a laplacian convolution filter as found in <d-cite key="placeholder"></d-cite>. Notably,
        the parameters only produce a partial cell-state update-vector that comprises all non-gene channels. The gene channels are cloned and appended to the update vector after the stochastic
    update step to prevent degradation over time. This leads to no change or propagation of gene channel information throughout the NCA cell.</p>

    <h3>GenePropCA</h3>

    <p>The GenePropCA model (<a href="#GeneProp" class="figure-link" data-target="GeneProp"></a>) is tasked with exploiting the gene embedding learned by the GeneCA.
    By conditioning the primitive growth in the GeneCA to specific embedding, these embeddings now carry latent information about the primitives. We assume that the latent information
    in each embedding can be modified to produce out-of-training behaviour, thus allowing the GenePropCA to both propagate and modify the genes to achieve a desired goal.
    The architecture of the GenePropCA is similar to that of the GeneCA, where the neural network parameters produce a partial cell state update. In this case, only the genes are updated. Like in
    the GeneCA, the un-updated cell states are cloned and appended after the asynchronous partial update, leading to the GenePropCA having no influence over non=gene channels. </p>

    <h3>Ensemble</h3>

    

    <p>The ensemble model uses the GeneCA and GenePropCA to produce the final morphology. The GeneCA works without the GenePropCA and will produce the primitives. The
    GenePropCA is dependent on the GeneCA as its parameters are trained to manipulate the GeneCA dynamics. At step N, the state of the CA is passed to the GeneCA, where it only modifies the visible and hidden channels
    to produce an intermediate state, the intermediate step is then passed to the GenePropCA, where only the gene encoding channels are modified to produce step N+1. The idea here is for the
    GenePropCA to learn to exploit the gene embedded dynamics of the GeneCA to produce more complex morphologies than that found in the GeneCA.</p>

    <h2>Hierarchical Growth Task --> I think this section should go before models</h2>

    <p>The traditional NCAs presented in <d-cite key="mordvintsev2020growing">"</d-cite> and extended upon in <d-cite key="placeholder, placeholder"></d-cite> use the neural-network
    parameters to encode the desired behaviour. In effect, the neural-network can be seen as the genome for the morphology, where for each distinct morphology a new NCA needs to be trained.
    Intern, this makes it particularly difficult to have coexisting morphologies, or even just coexisting dynamics, running on the same lattice, as the multiple NCAs end up interfering with each-other.</p>

    <p>Our model presents a possible solution to this problem ... <-- finish this paragraph</p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1"></a>
    <h3>Growing Coexisting Primitives</h3>

    <p>The first step in the hierarchical growth task is to grow coexisting morphologies. In effect, this means to grow multiple distinct morphologies using the same set of NCA parameters. Much like te original growth task, the
    multiple morphologies should be bounded and stable across time, with their shape unchanging once fully generated. </p>

    <h2>Training Procedure</h2>
    <p>A description of the training procedure. Talk about two training phases, the special pooling method to train multiple DNA at once
    and how the GeneNCa Weights are frozen when training the GeneProp NCA</p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-4.1" id="section-4.1"></a>
    <h3>GeneCA Training</h3>
    <p>GeneCA training is similar to the pool-training procedure presented in <d-cite key="mordvintsev2020growing"></d-cite>. However, to enable the gene encoding of multiple primitives,
    each gene-primitive pair is given its own pool to sample from and update. Additionally, the target image becomes a target batch consisting of n-repetitions of each image,
    where n is a factor of the batch size. It is important to keep the batch size as a multiple of the number of primitives to avoid training bias towards one primitive.</p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-4.2" id="section-4.2"></a>
    <h3>GenePropCA Training</h3>
    <p>GenePropCA training uses the same batch training technique as the GeneCA, we usually only train a single morphology, however multiple morphologies can be trained by
    sacrificing more channels to act as "meta genes". These meta genes are unaffected by both the GeneCA and GenePropCA. During the training of the GenePropCA the GeneCA weights are frozen,
    though their gradient contribution during the growth process is still used when backpropagating the loss to the GenePropCA. This ensures the GenePropCA's dynamics are
    conditioned on those of the GeneCA.</p>

    <h3>Growing Coexisting Morphologies from Primitives </h3>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-5.4" id="section-5.4"></a>
    <h3>Moving Primitives </h3>

    <p>In contrast to the relatively simple task of growing morphologies, we wanted to test if the GenePropCA could exploit the embedding and learn the dynamics of
    a complex system. For this we chose to replicate the dynamics of a Lenia glider. Lenia itself is a form of continuous CA that can exhibit remarkable complexity.
    We chose a glider (<a href="#originalLenia" class="figure-link" data-target="originalLenia"></a>)  whose dynamics where no trivial, where learning to replicate it
    would take more than simply memorising a simple pattern of motion. The GeneCA was trained on the first frame of the Lenia video. The GenePropCA was trained on a
    quasi curriculum style learning, where at certain checkpoints additional frames of the video are inserted into the training set. It is always trained from the first frame
    t0 the last frame of the training set in order, and loss was accumulated across all frames before backpropagation. The frame-by-frame loss accumulation is important here
    since, unlike growing morphologies, the time evolution of the NCA from state to state is important. As a comparison a standard NCA was trained using the same method, the parameter count
    of the standard NCA was selected such that it equaled the sum of total parameters between the GeneCA and the GenePropCA.</p>
